# Quising model

This repo contains a Rust implementation of the Wolff algorithm in order to find phase transition temperatures and possibly critical exponents of the Ising model for quasicrystalline lattices.

It is Jack Dinsmore's final project for Stanford's Condensed Matter Theory course in 2023.
